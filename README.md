## Is it ray tracing? No! 
## Is it cool? Yes! ;)

A small project aiming to show my current coding style and practices.

I wrote this game using an unusual approch when it comes to game development. It has a clean separation of the 2D game logic and the 3D graphical representation of the scene.
I find the result interesting.

The graphics is written in OpenGl using Cinder library which makes cumbersome OpenGl operations more convenient. 
Rendering is really efficient, employing batch rendering.

Reflections are visible in silver boxes thanks to orange boxes beeing rendered to a cubemap.

You can draw your own character and change their color!
